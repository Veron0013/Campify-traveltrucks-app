🌄 Campify: Travel Trucks

Campify: Travel Trucks is a modern web application for browsing and booking camper vans, built with Next.js and
TypeScript. The app allows users to explore a catalog of available campers, filter them by location, vehicle type, and
amenities, and view detailed specifications for each listing.

Each camper has a dedicated page featuring a photo gallery, full technical specs, user reviews, and an integrated
booking form for quick reservation requests. All data is sourced from MockAPI, with backend-driven filtering and
pagination ensuring accurate and efficient results.

Global application state is managed with Zustand, including a persistent list of favorite campers stored in
localStorage. Designed according to the provided UI mockups, Campify delivers a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly
interface for travelers searching for their next adventure on the road.
